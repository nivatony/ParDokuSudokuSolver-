# ParDoku Sudoku Solver

Welcome to the ParDoku Sudoku Solver project!

## Project Overview

This project is focused on designing a robust and scalable cloud architecture for the ParDoku Sudoku Solver. Our architecture includes the following key components:

- **Authentication Service**: We leverage the authentication service provided by ACME Inc. to ensure secure access to our application.

- **Dynamic Scaling**: Our cloud infrastructure is designed to dynamically scale based on demand, ensuring that we can handle varying workloads efficiently.

- **Token-Based CPU Usage Tracking**: To effectively manage costs, we implement token-based CPU usage tracking to monitor and control resource consumption.
